!!! The Client will only search for Lua scripts in this directory !!!
1. If your scripts doesn't show up, make sure that the folder is called (exactly!) "lua"
2. The client will recurse into subdirectories of an infinite depth when searching
3. Only scripts with the file ending ".lua" will be listed, anything else is ignored!

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

The lua files have been moved to an own repository. To get them back,
do this in the parent directory ("The AllTheHaxx folder"):

	git submodule update --init

Then...

LINUX USERS (PRECONDITION: a filesystem which supports symbolic links, e.g. ext4)
–––––––––––
Open a shell within THIS folder ("lua") and do:

	$ ln -sr ../Lua-Scripts/ official

then you can start the client and will see all the lua files back

So all in all, the following cli should do the job: (execute it in the directory of this info file)
	$ cd ..;git submodule update --init;cd lua;ln -s ../Lua-Scripts/ official

WINDOWS USERS
–––––––––––––
Copy-paste all the files from "Lua-Scripts" in this folder's parent directory into this folder.
I know, very inconvenient and static, but well... it's windows dude :\
